// sort means small Second/Crisp Gallery items get processed last and can
// find the host's bag already full of unrelated heavier items. Nudging
// their effective sort weight up (without ever exceeding a full-size

// Exact bin-constrained knapsack: `mandatory` items must ALL be included;
// `optional` items are chosen to maximize total value, subject to the
// combined set being packable into `bins` bins of `capacityPerBin` each.
//
// This treats per-player bag capacity as a real constraint from the
// start. The old approach (pooled knapsack against players*capacity,
// then a separate First-Fit-Decreasing split into individual bags) could
// report a value the crew couldn't actually carry — fitting a pooled
// total doesn't guarantee the chosen items can be partitioned into
// fixed-size bins (real bug report, 2026-08-01: a bag showing 110%
// full). Bin packing is NP-hard in general, but tractable here because
// every catalog weight — and capacityPerBin — share a common factor
// (10, today). `unit` is computed as a GCD rather than hardcoded /10, so
// this stays correct (just a bigger, still-small search) if a future
// item ever broke that pattern; see the "power drill loot" note in
// secondary-loot.json's _notes for why that's not expected.
//
// Bin CHOICE during reconstruction (below) follows a five-tier
// preference (tier 0 added 2026-08-07), applied uniformly to mandatory
// and optional items alike — this replaced an earlier version
// (2026-08-02) that tried bin 0 first for literally every item, which is
// why Buyer's Choice loot always used to land entirely in the host's bag
// (a real bug, not a rule: mandatory items are processed first, while
// bins are still symmetric, so bin 0 won that tie almost every time).
// Every tier only ever chooses AMONG bins already confirmed (via
// `solve()`) to preserve the DP's optimal total value — none of this can
// ever cost secondary value, which matters because every player's career
// progress is driven by that same total (see computeCareerProgress
// below), split evenly:
//   0. Vault items exclude bin 0 (the host) whenever a non-host,
//      value-preserving bin is also available — HOST_AVOID_FLOORS,
//      confirmed with the user 2026-08-07. The host alone must
//      physically enter the Vault for the Primary Target; routing Vault
//      secondary loot to a teammate instead lets it be grabbed in
//      parallel rather than requiring the host to double back for it
//      after the primary grab, which matters for the Elite Challenge's
//      17-minute clock. This is the mirror image of tier 1 below (which
//      pulls loot TOWARD the host) and falls back to including the host
//      when they're the only remaining valid bin (a solo run, or every
//      other bag already full).
//      Alarm Floor joined HOST_AVOID_FLOORS 2026-08-14 for a different
//      reason: the host's real route (Vault -> building 2nd floor, tier 1
//      below) never passes through Alarm Floor, so a host bag that also
//      picked up Alarm Floor loot forced a genuine backtrack during the
//      timed run — the same mechanism, applied for a pathing reason
//      rather than a parallelization one. First Floor was deliberately
//      excluded from this — it neighbors Second/Crisp Gallery directly,
//      so it isn't the same off-route detour.
//   1. Second and Crisp Gallery items prefer bin 0 (the host) —
//      HOST_PRIORITY_FLOORS, shared with assignItemsToBags() above.
//      Crisp Gallery's own rationale (confirmed with the user
//      2026-08-02): the host is the more reliable player to verify
//      in-room presence when using an EMP, given known desync behavior
//      in that specific room. Second joined it 2026-08-04, confirmed via
//      real heist mechanics: the host must physically enter the Vault
//      for the primary target at every crew size, and Loading Bay is
//      mutually exclusive with that Vault visit — so the host's route
//      naturally continues on to the building's 2nd floor (Second +
//      Crisp Gallery) afterward. Loading Bay was deliberately NOT added
//      here: it's isolated with no adjacency upside either way, and can
//      still land in the host's bag when capacity/ordering happens to
//      put it there — that's fine, since the host just sequences it
//      before or after the Vault trip rather than combining them.
//      **Real bug fix, 2026-08-09:** this tier used to only fire at the
//      moment a Second/Crisp Gallery item happened to be walked in
//      catalog order (Vault → Loading Bay → Alarm Floor → First → Second
//      → Crisp Gallery) — it had no way to reserve host capacity ahead of
//      time. Since Alarm Floor/First are walked first, an early
//      non-priority item could claim bin 0 via tier 4/5's symmetric-tie
//      default (all bins tie on the very first item of a run, and that
//      still resolves to bin 0), then tiers 2/3 would snowball more
//      same-/adjacent-floor loot into that same bag before any
//      Second/Crisp Gallery item was ever reached — a real report, host
//      ended up with a cross-floor Alarm Floor+First+partial-Second
//      mishmash while a teammate got the Second/Crisp-Gallery-heavy bag
//      that was supposed to be the host's. Fixed by walking
//      HOST_PRIORITY_FLOORS items ahead of every other floor in the
//      items list itself (see the sort just below `items` is built),
//      so tier 1 gets first claim on bin 0's capacity regardless of
//      catalog position or mandatory/optional status — catalog `order`
//      remains the tiebreak *within* each priority bucket, so this stays
//      just as Elite-toggle-independent as before. Reordering can only
//      ever change which of several equally-optimal bin partitions gets
//      realized (solve()'s total value is provably invariant to
//      processing order for a fixed set of symmetric bins) — never the
//      total secondary value or which items get selected.
//      **Real bug fix, 2026-08-10:** the above fix walked Second and
//      Crisp Gallery items ahead of everything else, but *within* that
//      priority bucket they still fell back to plain catalog order
//      (Second's items 2-A..2-D come before Crisp Gallery's 2-E/2-F in
//      the catalog). A real report: when combined Second + Crisp Gallery
//      weight exceeds one host bag, the smaller Second items greedily
//      claimed most of bin 0 first, leaving no room for the larger Crisp
//      Gallery paintings by the time their turn came up — those fell
//      through to a teammate instead, and an unrelated First-floor item
//      got adjacency-clustered into bin 0's last few units of capacity to
//      round it out, forcing an avoidable extra floor stop. This is
//      backwards: Crisp Gallery's host-preference is the *stronger* of
//      the two rationales (the EMP-desync room-verification requirement
//      above), while Second's is the *softer* one (the host's route just
//      happens to pass through). Fixed by giving the priority bucket its
//      own floor sub-rank — Crisp Gallery items are walked ahead of
//      Second items whenever both are present — so Crisp Gallery always
//      wins ties for bin 0's capacity over Second, matching which
//      rationale is actually the harder requirement. `order` still
//      breaks ties within a single floor. Same invariance argument as
//      above: this only changes which equally-optimal partition gets
//      realized, never the total value or item selection.
//   2. Otherwise, prefer a bin that already contains an item sharing the
//      same `.floor` — general floor-clustering, so a crew spends less
//      time running between floors to collect their assigned loot.
//      Items with `floor === undefined` never match each other here.
//   3. Otherwise, prefer a bin that already contains an item on an
//      ADJACENT floor per FLOOR_ADJACENCY below (e.g. Alarm Floor next
//      to First, or First next to Second/Crisp Gallery) — a softer nudge
//      than tier 2, confirmed with the user 2026-08-03 after live
//      testing showed a player jumping straight from Alarm Floor to
//      Second, skipping past First. This is a soft preference, not a
//      guarantee: if no value-preserving adjacent-floor bin exists at
//      this point in the reconstruction, it falls through to tier 4
//      exactly like the Crisp Gallery tier falls through when the
//      host's bag is full. Vault and Loading Bay are isolated — never
//      adjacent to anything, including each other.
//   4. Otherwise, prefer whichever candidate bin has the most remaining
//      capacity — spreads items across players by default instead of
//      piling into bin 0, which is what actually fixes the reported bug
//      in the common case (a plain ascending-index fallback would not
//      have, since it's indistinguishable from the old bug there).
//   5. Exact remaining-capacity ties: ascending bin index, purely for
//      determinism — no longer a host-favoring rule, just a tiebreaker.
//
// Returns null if `mandatory` alone can't be packed into the bins at
// all (the caller's cue to forfeit and fall back to an unconstrained
// pack). Otherwise returns { value, bags }: bags is a `bins`-length
// array of { items, value, weightUsed }, items shaped like the input
// objects ({ id, value, weightUnits, floor }).
//
// Note: `assignItemsToBags()` above has its own, separate
// HOST_PRIORITY_FLOORS/HOST_PRIORITY_BOOST logic — that function is
// untouched by this change, kept only as a tested primitive for a
// possible future "Greedy" model. `packBins()`'s tier 1 below now reads
// the very same HOST_PRIORITY_FLOORS constant directly (2026-08-04) —

  // report: a 2-player run where the host's Crisp-Gallery-only capacity
  // (100) exactly matched four selected Crisp Gallery items' combined
  // weight, but plain catalog order walked four *smaller* items
  // (Fertility Statue 20, Gemstone 30, Meteorite Fragment 20, Art Deco
  // Circlets 10 = 80) into the host bag first, leaving only 20 capacity
  // free — not enough for the fifth, larger selected item (Venus
  // d'Algernon, 30), which fell through to the teammate's bag along with
  // a still-mostly-empty slice of host capacity backfilled by two
  // unrelated First-floor items. That forced the host to detour to First
  // Floor for no reason, when swapping Venus d'Algernon in for the two
  // First-floor items (and Art Deco Circlets) would have given the host
  // an entirely Crisp-Gallery bag at the exact same total value — a valid
  // equally-optimal partition the old ordering simply never reached.
  // Largest-first is the standard bin-packing fix for this shape of
  // problem (place the item with the least placement flexibility first,

  // either item is non-priority) so every other tier's behavior, and
  // every non-priority floor's processing order, is untouched. `order`
  // remains the final tiebreak within same-floor items of equal weight.
  // 2026-08-15: within the priority pool itself, mandatory items now walk
  // ahead of optional ones, regardless of which of the two priority floors
  // they're on. Real bug report: a 2-player run where four *optional*
  // Crisp Gallery items were walked (per the 2026-08-13 largest-first rule
  // above) and greedily claimed 80 of the host's 100 capacity before a
  // *mandatory* Second item (Horse Statue, weight 30) ever got a turn —
  // only 20 capacity remained, not enough for it, so it was forced into
  // the non-host bag purely because of processing order. The host's

  // documented EMP-desync rationale (Crisp Gallery needs the host in-room
  // to verify presence; Second's host-preference is only the softer
  // "route happens to pass through" one). `floorSubRank` below is
  // untouched, so that preference still holds for optional-vs-optional
  // ties.
  //
  // Instead, `mandatoryRank` is layered in ABOVE `floorSubRank` (but still
  // gated to `priorityRank(a) === 0`, so it's a no-op outside the priority
  // pool): a mandatory item now claims host capacity before any optional
  // priority-floor item gets a chance to crowd it out, on either floor.
  // This only changes behavior when a mandatory and an optional item are
  // both competing in the pool — optional-vs-optional ties still fall
  // through to `floorSubRank` exactly as before. Verified against the
  // full existing suite (96/96 unchanged, including the Crisp-Gallery-
  // outranks-Second test and the 2026-08-13 largest-priority-floor-item
  // test) before landing this. Same invariance guarantee as every other
  // reordering fix in this file: only changes which equally-optimal
  // partition gets realized, never total value or item selection.
  //
  // 2026-08-15, same day, later: the `mandatoryRank` key above reopened
  // exactly the invariant the 2026-08-04 `order` fix was written to
  // guarantee — but only for the Elite-off case. `packBins()` only ever
  // sets `it.mandatory = true` when Elite forces Buyer's Choice picks into
  // the mandatory knapsack branch (`runOptimizer()`'s `mandatory =
  // eligible.filter(l => l.buyersChoice)`); with Elite off, `packBins()` is
  // always called with `mandatory: []`, so `mandatoryRank` silently became
  // a no-op and the pre-bug-#5 crowding bug reappeared — even when Elite on
  // vs off select the exact same items. Real report: a scope-out where
  // `elite:'yes'` gave a clean Second/Crisp-Gallery host bag, but the same
  // scope-out with `elite:'no'` put a First-floor stray back in the host
  // bag, same $712,000 total, same items selected either way.
  //
  // Fixed by widening the key to `(it.mandatory || it.buyersChoice)`. This
  // is a strict generalization, not a behavior change for Elite-on: every
  // item `packBins()` ever marks `mandatory: true` is already
  // `buyersChoice: true` by construction, so `it.mandatory` already implies
  // `it.buyersChoice` and that path is bit-for-bit unaffected. Elite-off
  // gains the missing case: a Buyer's-Choice-marked item that got selected
  // by pure value-max now gets the same priority-pool precedence a
  // forced-mandatory item would, closing the gap.
  //
  // Important scoping, discussed with the user before implementing: this
  // only guarantees "same selected item set -> same bag split." It does
  // NOT claim Elite on/off always produce identical splits, because they
  // don't always select the same items — forcing a low value-density
  // Buyer's Choice pick (e.g. a painting; every painting in this catalog is
  // weight 50, the heaviest class, vs 10/20/30 for everything else) can
  // cost enough value that the unconstrained Elite-off pack drops it for
  // something better. When selection genuinely diverges, the two runs are
  // packing different items and their splits are expected to differ too —
  // that's not a regression. See the "diverging-selection sanity test" in
  // test/pack-bins.test.js for the case where selection is NOT equal.

// top. So `buyerRequestBonusEach` below is now earned whenever the

// even with Elite off — the >=2-picks minimum still applies either way
// (confirmed with the user 2026-08-07: it's a Buyer's-Choice-contract
// minimum, not an Elite-specific one). `eliteBonusEach` stays gated
// strictly behind the Elite toggle, unchanged — completing it depends on
// live-execution conditions this tool can't verify from bag contents
